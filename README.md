# Rust Code Challenges: Challenge 13

Your challenge is to create a representation for CSS and HTML 
color codes, e.g. #RRGGBB, and implement `std::fmt::FromStr` for that
type so that it can be parsed.


## Testing your solution

Use `cargo test` to evaluate yourself:

```console
$ cargo test
...
running 2 tests
test read_only ... ok
test writeable ... ok
...
```
