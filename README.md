# Rust Code Challenges: Challenge 15

Your challenge is to create a parser for dates that can accept
multiple date formats. You'll need to be able to handle different
delimiters and missing data.


## Testing your solution

Use `cargo test` to evaluate yourself:

```console
$ cargo test
...
running 5 tests
test dmy_dot ... ok
test mdy_dot ... ok
test invalid ... ok
test ymd_hyphen ... ok
test ymd_slash ... ok
...
```
