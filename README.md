# Rust Code Challenges: Challenge 10

Your challenge is to implement a function that
can sum `Vec<Option<i32>>`. In words, this means
that your function needs to be able to handle
missing values.

## Testing your solution

Use `cargo test` to evaluate yourself:

```console
$ cargo test
...
running 4 tests
test all_missing ... ok
test no_missing ... ok
test empty ... ok
test some_missing ... ok
...
```
